## Final Project Overview

This project will help you create a personalized learning platform for software developers using ChatGPT.

It involves creating prompts that can be run in a generative AI classroom ChatGPT environment to build a learning platform that provides personalized learning recommendations based on existing courses.

You will explore using ChatGPT to gather requirements for the app, design tables and databases in MongoDB, and use prompts to generate code in Node and Express.js endpoints. You will observe how ChatGPT provides recommendations based on the generated code.

You will learn to generate test cases to test the endpoints of the code and, finally, create a Dockerfile for deploying the app. You can push the code to GitHub at each step and also execute the endpoints in the Cloud IDE.
